"""
Shared journal + equity tracking - STRAT 1 forward test.

Design: identical risk/R-multiple/equity logic to the original
portfolio-forward-test journal.py (per-strategy % of current equity,
10% total open-risk cap, 5x-of-starting-capital compounding cap,
R-multiple tracking, £ P&L conversion). See that file's own docstring
for the full mechanical explanation if needed - not repeated here.

WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS FILE: this is a clean, minimal build
containing ONLY the 4 strategies that passed the exhaustive
combinatorial search across all 10 validated strategies (2026-09-22),
each rescaled to exactly 6% MaxDD:

    Pivot S/R + Overnight Extension + Divergence-Fade + COT Positioning Extreme
    CAGR 9.86%, MaxDD -6.00%, Sharpe 1.629

STRAT 1 ADMISSION RULE (apply this every time a new strategy is
validated, before ever adding it here):

    A new strategy is added to Strat 1 ONLY IF re-running the full
    exhaustive combinatorial search (now across the CURRENT Strat 1
    members + the new candidate, i.e. up to 2^(n+1)-1 combinations)
    finds a combination that GENUINELY IMPROVES CAGR at the exact same
    6% MaxDD ceiling, compared to the current Strat 1 CAGR figure
    above. Not "looks promising alone" - not "positive Sharpe" - the
    full re-optimization has to show a real, verified improvement to
    the actual combined number, using the same binary-search-to-exact-
    6%-MaxDD method used to find this very configuration.

    If a new strategy passes: rebuild STRATEGY_RISK_PCT below using
    that verified re-optimization's output (not the strategy's own
    standalone sizing), re-verify the combined MaxDD is still exactly
    -6.00% (not "close"), and update the CAGR/Sharpe figures in this
    docstring and the file's own header to match.

    If a new strategy does NOT pass: it does not belong in Strat 1,
    regardless of how good it looks in isolation - it goes in Capital
    instead (see journal_capital_config.py), which has no such
    admission bar because it has no drawdown ceiling to protect.

Every other validated strategy not currently in this list (Donchian,
Connors RSI, Monday Effect, RSI(2), TGA-Follow, VIX Shock-Fade) has
already been tested against this bar and did NOT improve on the
current 4 - they remain valid, live in Capital, just not admitted
here.
